# BG Thoughts And Quotes. #


The exercise recreates an API project for thoughts and quotes from Bulgarian folklore, some of which are from prominent Bulgarians.

That is a test project for learning purposes and one of my first Golang codes.
So I cannot vouch for the correctness of the code and approaches and its quality in a production environment.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the package locally.
* Go to the directory of your local copy.

* The go.mod and go.sum files are excluded. Look at the very bottom of the gitignore file. So you have to set up the service locally.

```sh
  go mod init bg-quotes
  go mod tidy
```

* Start the system.

```sh
  go run main.go
```
